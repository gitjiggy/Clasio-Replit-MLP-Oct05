I need a landing page when users first come to clasio.ai. Use the following artifacts to create a world-class, award winning sleek looking landing page. Ask clarifying questions before implementing.

The landing page should be mobile friendly. fast, responsive and great on desktop. Stack: HTML + Tailwind (or your default with utility-class equivalents).
Tone: clean, modern, trustworthy.

Take careful note of the hero image. Be sure to use it top and center along with a "Sign Up Free" and "Sign In" buttons. The Sign In button will obviously replace the "Continue with Google" finctionality we have right now. The modal for "Continue with Google" shall thus completely go away, with only the functionality remaining, which will now be "Sign In".

For the whole website, be consistent with the logo's color schemes which are:

CMYK: 0%, 0%, 0%, 0%; RGB: 255, 255, 255; HEX: #ffffff
CMYK: 0%, 17%, 77%, 2.0%; RGB: 250, 207, 57; HEX: #facf39
CMYK: 65%, 26%, 0%, 4.7%; RGB: 85, 179, 243; HEX: #55b3f3

Layout & responsiveness

Mobile first. 16–24px base, 28–36px H1 on mobile; scale up to 48–56px on desktop.

Max content width ~1120px; generous padding (px-6 mobile, px-8 md, px-10 lg).

Use a 3-step card row that snaps to a single stacked column on mobile.

Use a 2×2 grid for the 4 value props on desktop; stacked cards on mobile.

Keep line length 45–70 characters; increase line-height to ~1.5.

Cards: rounded-2xl, soft shadow, 16–24px padding.

Icons: line icons (Lucide/Feather); one per step/value prop.

Motion: subtle fade/slide on scroll; 150–250ms; reduce-motion respected.

Accessibility: WCAG AA contrast; focus states; alt text for images.

Nice touches

Sticky nav with transparent → solid on scroll.

Dark mode toggle (optional).

OG meta + favicon.

Splecial Notes pay attention
we also have a "demo mode", "camera capture" and "voice search" fucntionality that's not built yet. (As a reminder, in demo mode:
Allow non-logged-in users to upload 1 document, see AI classification, and search). You should layout demo mode facade i.e. text and buttons but without any functionality. We will build that later. Same goes true for camera capture and voice search.

now please ask any questions you may have
