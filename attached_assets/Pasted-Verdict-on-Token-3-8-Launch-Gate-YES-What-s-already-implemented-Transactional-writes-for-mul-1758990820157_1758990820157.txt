Verdict on Token 3/8 (Launch Gate: YES)
What‚Äôs already implemented (‚úÖ)

Transactional writes for multi-step document/version flows

createDocument(...) in server/storage.ts wraps the document insert and the initial version (v1) insert in a single db.transaction, so creating a doc and its first version is atomic.

createDocumentVersion(...) uses a transaction that locks the parent document (FOR UPDATE), calculates the next version, inserts the version, and (later) updates state atomically.

setActiveVersion(...) and deleteDocumentVersion(...) each use a transaction with document lock + coordinated updates across document_versions and documents. This avoids races and ‚Äútwo active versions‚Äù bugs.

Long operations are not inside transactions: expensive GCS calls (delete/restore) are done outside DB transactions (good).

Multi-tenant scoping is broadly respected

Many list/read/update queries include userId conditions (or call helpers that already filtered by user) to keep tenant data isolated.

So your core multi-write versioning flows are correctly transactional and fairly safe under concurrency. üëç

What‚Äôs not implemented (‚ùå) or incomplete for Token 3

No idempotency for write operations

I searched the entire server and schema; there‚Äôs no idempotency table or unique key (no ‚Äúidempotency‚Äù, ‚Äúrequest_key‚Äù, ‚Äúclient_operation_id‚Äù, ‚Äúversion_hash unique‚Äù etc.).

Re-trying the same create/update call today can create duplicate rows (e.g., two identical versions) if the client retries on a network hiccup.

Analytics/events aren‚Äôt gated to ‚Äúpost-commit only‚Äù

Analytics (e.g., dailyApiUsage) are written independently, not coordinated with the surrounding transaction. If a multi-step write fails after analytics increment, you can get ‚Äúghost‚Äù analytics.

Some updates don‚Äôt include tenantId in the final WHERE

E.g., setActiveVersion and deleteDocumentVersion validate the version belongs to the document, but subsequent updates are scoped just by IDs, not by userId/tenantId. If a bad docId leaks across contexts, you could mutate a doc outside the current tenant. (Safer pattern: include userId in every update WHERE.)

No explicit logs around transaction boundaries

There‚Äôs no structured log with reqId/tenantId/docId indicating BEGIN / COMMIT / ROLLBACK. Tracing failures will be harder under load.

No rollback tests / failpoints

There are no temporary failpoints to simulate a mid-flow crash and verify that no partial rows survive.

Exactly what to tell Replit to do (step-by-step, no code)
A) Add idempotency for write flows (this is launch-gating)

Define the contract: every create/update that can be retried must accept a client idempotency key (or deterministically derive one, e.g., docId + versionContentHash).

Persist keys with a unique constraint and a TTL (so the table doesn‚Äôt grow forever). Store: key, tenantId, operationType, payloadHash, resultId, createdAt, expiresAt.

Enforce once-only semantics:

On first execution, write normally, store the key ‚Üí resultId in the same transaction as the main write.

On retry with the same key (and same payload), return the cached result and do not write again.

If the same key arrives with different payload, reject clearly (409 Conflict with explanation).

Use deterministic keys for version writes when practical:

Example: use a content hash of the version body + docId to dedupe accidental double-uploads.

Safeguards

Scope idempotency by tenantId to prevent cross-tenant reuse.

Add a short TTL (e.g., 24‚Äì72h) to clean old keys.

Add a unique index on (tenantId, key).

Acceptance

Retrying a create/update with the same key returns the same result and does not create a duplicate version/document.

Changing the payload under the same key is cleanly rejected (no partial writes).

B) Move analytics/events after commit

For each transaction that writes DB state, move analytics emission to a post-commit step (after the transaction promise resolves).

If a transaction rolls back, no analytics should be emitted.

Safeguards

Keep analytics out of the transaction to avoid slow commits.

If analytics fails after a commit, log and retry later; never roll back the main data because analytics failed.

Acceptance

Induced mid-transaction failure produces no analytics.

Successful commit ‚Üí analytics emitted exactly once.

C) Strengthen tenant scoping on updates (defense-in-depth)

On any UPDATE/DELETE that changes document state, include tenantId/userId in the final WHERE even if you already checked earlier (belt-and-suspenders).

On setActiveVersion / deleteDocumentVersion, ensure the final updates also include userId = <current>.

Safeguards

Keep existing pre-checks; this just narrows the blast radius if an ID is ever mis-scoped upstream.

Acceptance

Contract test: a user from Tenant B cannot flip versions or delete a version for Tenant A by guessing IDs.

D) Add transaction boundary logging

On entry to the high-risk flows (create doc, create version, set active, delete version), log a structured BEGIN with reqId, tenantId, userId, docId, operation.

On success, log COMMIT; on failure, log ROLLBACK plus a short error code.

Safeguards

No PII or secret content in logs; just identifiers and codes.

Acceptance

In logs, you can trace any write end-to-end using reqId and see where it failed.

E) Add temporary failpoints to verify rollback

Add a feature-flagged fault mid-flow (e.g., throw between document insert and version insert).

Run the flow and confirm the transaction rolls back cleanly.

Remove or disable the failpoint after the test.

Acceptance

After the forced fault, the DB contains no partial document or version rows.
